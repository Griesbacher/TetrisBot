## How it workers

### Block recognition

To recognize the blocks a self written Computer Vision algorithm has been designed. It works with based on the shape and not on colors, so it is portable to other Tetris versions, which has also been tested already.

### AI

The AI is pretty simple and based on a fitness function, like used in generic algorithms.
